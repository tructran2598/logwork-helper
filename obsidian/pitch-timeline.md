## Dependency Notes

- P1 made preview resolution safer, which became the baseline for P6 and P7.
- P2 made auth failures safer, which made P8 diagnostics more useful.
- P3 clarified onboarding before the manual UI was refactored in P5.
- P5 made the manual UI easier to change, enabling the focused P9 draft-scope hardening.
- P6 made preview cache safer; P10 made MCP apply require cached provenance.
- P11 and P12 moved auth/network behavior closer to production-grade failure handling.
- P13 made release checks repeatable after the safety and reliability hardening.
- P14, P15, and P16 improved operational supportability.
- P17 made write approval easier to review before apply.
- P18 added fixture-based API contract coverage.
- P19 continued manual UI maintainability after the manual REPL direction was clearer.
- P20 closed the final release-review safety pass across approval immutability, duplicate apply prevention, HTTPS/origin rules, diagnostics privacy, retry hygiene, normalization fallback, and test env isolation.
- P21 handled the prioritized P20 deferred cleanup: per-file config/draft locks, shared project identity and list navigation helpers, and explicit normalization result APIs with backward compatibility.
